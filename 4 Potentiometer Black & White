// The purpose of this exercise is to measure the bit value from the
// analog input and to transfer it to an RGB to change the color from
// black to white depending on the variable resistance

int blue = A1; // associates pin A1 with the blue pin on the RGB
int green = A2; // associates pin A2 with the green pin on the RGB
int readpin = A4 // associates pin A4 with the name readpin

int bitvalue = analogRead (readpin); // read the bit value

int writevalue = (bitvalue/4); 
// divide the read value by 4 to obtain an 8-bit value for analogWrite


analogWrite (red, writevalue); // associates whatever bitvalue A4 has to each
analogWrite (blue, writevalue); // of the RGB pins in order to create the most
analogWrite (green, writevalue); // color (white) or the least (black)
